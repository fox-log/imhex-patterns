# Fox's Imhex Patterns
[Imhex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex) is a hex editor expressly developed for reverse engineering.
It provides a number of tools for examining and decoding binary structures with the most powerfull being its [Pattern Language](https://docs.werwolv.net/pattern-language).
The Pattern Language allows users to define and decode complex binary structures and examine the structure of a file. The patterns are stored as `.hexpat` files and a large community generated repository of them can be found [here](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Patterns)

This repository contains my own `.hexpat` files, created as I come across formats that don't already have a pattern or because I wanted to learn about the format.
